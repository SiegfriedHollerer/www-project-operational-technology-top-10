## List provided by Simon

We're currently collecting potential candiates within [the repo](/docs/potential-top-10).

2. [Missing/insufficient Vulnerability management](/the-top-10/missing-vulnerability-management/)
3. Insufficient/missing network separation
4. Lax access controls  (account /user based)  - least privilege
5. Intentional misconfiguration for ease of use (e.g. leaving rtu’s in upload mode)
6. Missing configuration backups for OT-Devices
7. Legacy devices
8. Unmanaged external access (from above purdue model level 3 / IEC62443 zones/conduits )
9. Alert fatigue with “dirty” environment
10. Undefined processes for alert reporting/handling

## List provided by christopher

- Lack of authentication
- use of insecure 3rd party items - HW / SW assets with critical vulnerabilities
- available JTAG/SWD interface left enabled on production devices
- lack of encryption / minimal encryption
- lack of hardening peripheral devices in the system, exposing devices to possible vulnerabilities
- broadly: trying to wiggle out of security features via deflection to obscurity
- weak built-in security features like basic Bluetooth
- lack of encryption for mobile apps, log files and PHI/PII
- not protecting the BIOS/boot order
